Epoka Unified System (EUS)

A lot of students struggle with deadlines. They have a hard time keeping up with everything going on around them
This is due to the large workload students have to deal with in a daily basis.

Our system introduces a way for solving this problem by keeping track of every activity, event or deadline the students have.
EUS does this by incorporating notifications as its primary way of communicating with the user. Through using this system the student
will have access on all of his data, which include, but are not limmited to, attendance, grades, courses, timetables. Further more the user will be able to ineract with the professors through the use of notifications. 

EUS main purpose is to provide an easy-to-use tool that students can use to be on top of their schedule and interact with the professors of the respective courses they have chosen. A lot of focus is given to individualism on EUS. Every student will have the ability to choose what notifications to see, which course hours can be seen at the timetable etc. On the other side EUS provides the professors with options that make it easy for them to specify which students will get their notifications, which makes the whole experience of EUS much more specialised.
