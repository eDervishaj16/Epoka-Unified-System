Epoka Unified System (EUS)

A lot of students struggle with deadlines. They have a hard time keeping up with everything going on around them
This is due to the large workload studnets have to deal with in a daily basis.

Our system introduces a way for solving this problem by keeping track of every activity, event or deadline the students have
EUS does this by incorporating notifications as its primary way of communicating with the user. Through using this system the student
will have access on all of his data, which include, but are not limmited to, attendance, grades, courses, timetables. Further more the user will be able to 
to ineract with the professors through the use of notifications.
